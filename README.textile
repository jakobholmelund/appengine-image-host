h1. Google AppEngine File/Image Hosting

Purposely simple file/image management application for use on Google AppEngine.

h2. Background

This is a fork of the image-host. This version is now a full fledged file-host. You can upload css and javascript-files when doing this the app will both save a compressed version as well as the original if you wish to edit later from a different location. I have also implemented the blob-store so that you can save ANY kind of file under 50mb.

The Compression for css is YUI and the compression for javascriptfiles is googles closure algorithm which should be the best of them all.

h2. Usage

For the most part it's just a matter of deploying to AppEngine which I won't cover here. Read the official documentation for details.

By default images are viewable by everyone but the upload panel is only available to the administration for your account. If you want to make that available to any registered user then change the following line in the app.yaml configuration file.

pre. - url: /.*
  script: backend.py
  login: admin

To this:

pre. - url: /.*
  script: backend.py
  login: required
