h1. Google AppEngine File/Image Hosting

Purposely simple file/image management application for use on Google AppEngine.

h2. Background

I like to add the odd image to a blog post now and then, but hate having to upload and resize images so they fit nicely. This simple application scratches that itch. Simply upload and resize images and then host them from AppEngine. It was also the perfect opportunity to play with the Image API.

h2. Usage

For the most part it's just a matter of deploying to AppEngine which I won't cover here. Read the official documentation for details.

By default images are viewable by everyone but the upload panel is only available to the administration for your account. If you want to make that available to any registered user then change the following line in the app.yaml configuration file.

pre. - url: /.*
  script: backend.py
  login: admin

To this:

pre. - url: /.*
  script: backend.py
  login: required

This fork adds the possibility to host any kind of file through the blobstore, and has a special-case for css-files with the possibility to YUI-copress the css at upload-time, i might add this to be done on the fly.. Or actually this is gonna happen for sure.
